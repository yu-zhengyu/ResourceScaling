# ResourceScaling
This project will encompass the following learning objectives:

1. Use cloud APIs to programmatically control resources in response to demand.
2. Be able to deploy web services that account for failure, cost and performance constraints.
3. Compare and contrast the APIs used in AWS and Azure.
4. Be able to identify and explain the need for handling resource failures.
5. Be able to explain the need for distributing load evenly among all resources.
6. Configure and deploy a Load Balancer along with an VM Scale Set on Azure.
7. Configure and deploy an Elastic Load Balancer along with an Auto Scaling Group on AWS.
8. Develop solutions that manage cloud resources with the ability to deal with resource failure.
9. Account for cost as a constraint when provisioning cloud resources.
10. Analyze the trade off between maximizing performance & reliability and the effect on cost.
